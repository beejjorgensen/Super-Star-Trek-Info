This is a reverse-engineering WIP to write a spec for the classic game
Super Star Trek from _Basic Computer Games, Microcomputer Edition_.

## Specification

This is a "clean room" description of the game.

* TODO

## Documents

* [101 BASIC Computer Games, Microcomputer Edition](doc/sst_bcgmc.pdf)
* [MBASIC-80 Reference Manual](doc/mbasic80_refman.pdf)
* [Original SPACEWR from 101 BASIC Computer Games)](doc/spacewr_101bcg.pdf)
* [Game instructions text file](doc/instructions.txt)

## Source

This is the probably-completely-correct version as appeared in 101 BASIC
Games Microcomputer Edition. It has been diffed against the version that
appeared on the [Vintage-BASIC](http://www.vintage-basic.net/) website
and compared against a physical copy of the book.

All typos have been reproduced them faithfully from the source.
